# iOS Mobile Weather Tutorial
## Contact support@pubnub.com for any questions and comments!

This tutorial is designed to show you how to stream the data from the vehicle's infotainment head unit on PubNub's global data stream network using the SmartDeviceLink SDK in your app.

This tutorial is based on an existing SmartDeviceLink tutorial located [here](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_mobileweather_tutorial_ios/wiki).

This repo is intended to interact with our [Qt demo project](https://github.com/pubnub/PubNubQtSync.git).

Don't forget to sign up for a [PubNub sub-key and pub-key](https://admin.pubnub.com/#/login).

To get started, run this in the project's root directory:
```
pod install
```

Also, please check out these links if you'd like more information on PubNub's native [C](https://github.com/pubnub/c-core/tree/master/c), [C++](https://github.com/pubnub/c-core/tree/master/cpp), [iOS](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/ios-objective-c/pubnub-objective-c-sdk-v4), and basic [Qt Wrapper](https://github.com/pubnub/c-core/tree/master/qt) clients.

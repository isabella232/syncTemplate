# iOS Mobile Weather Tutorial

This tutorial is designed to show you how to stream the data from the vehicle's infotainment head unit on PubNub's global data stream network using the SmartDeviceLink SDK in your app.

This tutorial is based on an existing SmartDeviceLink tutorial located [here](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_mobileweather_tutorial_ios/wiki).

This repo is intended to link to our [Qt demo project](https://github.com/jzucker2/PubNubQtSync.git)

To get started, run this in the project's root directory:
```
pod install
```
